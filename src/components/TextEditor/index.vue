        <h1 class="text-4xl mb-6">How to write better as a developer</h1>
        <p class="">Recently, I had two programming friends point out to me the importance of writing skills. It makes sense to pay attention to what they say because:
        <ul class="py-4">
            <li>one runs an online product company,</li>
            <li>and the other jumped from a bootcamp graduate to a lead developer within just a few years.</li>
        </ul>
</p>
    </div>
